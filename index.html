        What is the Quran?
        The most conventional answer is that the Quran is a book - but it is not like most books.
        It is made up of words which contain truth and guidance for every human being and Muslims believe that these are words revealed directly by God in the Arabic language to the last of His prophets and messengers Muhammad (peace be upon him)
        The Quran presents itself with a number of names and descriptions which are worth reflecting on.
